 **MAGLEV:**
								 
The magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) is a non-contact technology. It reduces the cost of maintenance as there is no friction, so the energy efficiency is high. This technology is the future in
transportation, non-contact actuators, precision engineering, non-contact structures, satellite launching, etc.

Magnetic Levitation System (MLS) is an electromagnetic device which levitates ferromagnetic elements using principle of electromagnetism. MLS technology eliminates mechanical contacts between moving and stationary
parts thereby reducing the friction. Due to the reduction in friction, MLS offers many advantages such as low noise, ability to work in high vacuum environment, high precision positioning platforms. MLS generally works on
three kinds of forces namely propulsion, levitation and guidance force. Propulsion force is to push the moving part forward, levitation force is to lift up the moving part, and guidance force is to avoid derailing. 
The repulsive force is responsible for magnetic levitation. MLS has numerous applications like ability to work in high vacuum environment but due to the
constant need of levitation, MLS is subjected to continuously changing parameters and hence the mathematical model is highly nonlinear. There have been several attempts to model and control the MLS . Though the magnetic levitation is having non linear behavior and it is described by non linear differential equation, mostly design approaches are based on linear model.
															
								
**Dynamic modeling of a magnetic levitation system (MLS) :**
								
MLS consists of a ferromagnetic ball , suspended in a voltage controlled magnetic field. Ferromagnetic core coil acts as an actuator, sensor determines the position of the ball with respect to the core coil.
Fig. 1 shows the schematic diagram of the studied MLS which consists of magnetic levitation mechanical unit (electromagnet, sensors, and ferromagnetic ball) with a computer
interface card, a signal conditioning unit, connecting cables. There are two inputs to the system - reference input signal u and coil current i.
Magnetic levitation system modeling is based on model linearization using Taylor’s series.

The simplest non linear model of MAGLEV relating the ball position <span class="fontCss3">x</span> and coil current <span class="fontCss3">i</span> is :

$$m . \ddot{x} = m . g - k \frac{i^2}{x^2} ...(1)$$
								
where <span class="fontCss3">k</span> is a constant depending on the coil (electromagnet) parameters, g is the acceleration due to gravity.
To present the full phenomenological model a relation between the control voltage <span class="fontCss3">u</span> and 
the coil current <span class="fontCss3">i</span> would have to be introduced analysing the whole MAGLEV circuitry. However MAGLEV is equipped with an inner control loop providing
a current proportional to the control voltage that is generated for control purpose:

$$i = k_1 . u ...(2)$$

Equations (1) and (2) constitute a nonlinear model.
<span class="fontCss3">k<sub>1</sub></span> is control voltage to coil current gain.
The bound for the control signal is set to (-5V to +5V).<br/>

<br/>

MAGLEV is a SISO plant – single input single output (fig 2).
Ball Position is the model output and voltage is the control signal.

As the system dynamics is nonlinear, for analysis and controller design purpose it is linearized around an equilibrium point 
<span class="fontCss3">x<sub>0</sub></span>, <span class="fontCss3">i<sub>0</sub></span>. At this point we consider 
$$\ddot{x} = 0$$
								
Hence,
$$k = \frac{mgx_0^2}{i_0^2} ....(3)$$

Equation (1) can be written as,

$$\ddot{x_0} = g - f(i,x), \ f(i,x) = k \frac{i^2}{m.x^2}..(4)$$

At equilibrium point,

$$g = f(i,x)...(5)$$


For linearization purpose let,

$$x = x_0 + \Delta x$$
$$i = i_0 + \Delta i$$
								
where &Delta;<span class="fontCss3">x</span> is the small deviation from the equilibrium position 
<span class="fontCss3">x<sub>0</sub></span> and &Delta;<span class="fontCss3">i</span> is the small deviation from the equilibrium coil current
<span class="fontCss3">i<sub>0</sub></span>.


A linearization is done at the equilibrium point of 
<span class="fontCss3">x<sub>0</sub></span> = -1.5 V (the position is expressed in volts), 
<span class="fontCss3">i<sub>0</sub></span> = 0.8 A

The linearization steps are the following:

$$\ddot{x} = -(\frac{\delta f(i,x)}{\delta i} \vert_{i_0,x_0} \Delta i + \frac{\delta f(i,x)}{\delta x} |_{i_0,x_0} \Delta x ), ...(6)$$

$$s^2\Delta x = -( k_i \Delta i -k_x \Delta x ),$$

$$s^2\Delta x - k_x \Delta x = - k_i \Delta i,$$

$$\Delta x( s^2 - k_x ) = - k_i \Delta i,$$

$$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta i} = \frac{-k_i}{ s^2 - k_x } ...(7)$$

where,

$$k_i = \frac{2g}{i_0}$$
$$k_x = \frac{2g}{x_0}$$
								
Coil current <span class="fontCss3">i</span> proportional to the control voltage 
<span class="fontCss3">u</span>, i.e. <span class="fontCss3">i = k</span><sub>1</sub> . <span class="fontCss3">u</span>, 
<span class="fontCss3">k</span><sub>1</sub> being the proportionality constant.
The transfer function becomes,

$$\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta u} = \frac{-k_1 k_i}{ s^2 - k_x }...(8)$$

where &Delta;<span class="fontCss3">u</span> is the incremental control voltage from its equilibrium value. Finally, considering the (IR) sensor is
linear with gain <span class="fontCss3">k</span><sub>2</sub>, the overall plant transfer function can be written as,

$$P(s) = \frac{\Delta x_v}{\Delta u} = \frac{-k_1 k_2 k_i}{ s^2 - k_x }....(9)$$

where <span class="fontCss3">x<sub>v</sub></span> is the sensor output (in volt). Note from the expression of
<span class="fontCss3">k<sub>i</sub></span> and
<span class="fontCss3">k<sub>x</sub></span> that this linearized system is independent of levitation-ball mass.
The parameters of the physical system considered are presented in list below. With these parameters, the plant transfer function becomes

$$P(s) = \frac{b}{s^2 - p^2} = \frac{-3518.85}{s^2 - 2180}...(10)$$

**Plant Control:**
								
A general schematic of a simple control closed loop system is presented in fig 3.<br/><br/>

<br/>
								
								
Assuming that the plant is represented by its linear model its transfer function can be described as:<br/>
 
$$G(s) = \frac{B(s)}{A(s)}$$
								 
where <span class="fontCss3">s</span> is the laplace operator. The idea of control algorithms is to find such a controller (transfer function, discrete transfer function, any nonlinear), 
which will fulfill our requirements (certain dynamic response, certain frequency of damping, good response to the dynamic changes of the desired value etc.).
Every controller’s input is the <span class="fontCss3">e(t)</span> error signal. Sometimes disturbance signals are also measured. Depending on the present and past values of the error signal, 
the controller performs such an action (changes the <span class="fontCss3">u(t)</span> control signal) that the <span class="fontCss3">y(t)</span> is as close to the
<span class="fontCss3">y<sub>desired</sub> (t)</span> value as possible at all times.
There are a lot of controller design and tuning methods. All of them consider the behavior of the closed loop system and provide controller parameters according to 
the assumed system characteristics. With the known plant transfer function <span class="fontCss3">G</span><span class="fontCss2">(s)</span> it is possible to find satisfactory parameters of the <span class="fontCss3">C</span><span class="fontCss2">(s)</span> controller such that 
the closed loop system will have the desired characteristics described by the transfer function <span class="fontCss3">T<sub>c</sub></span><span class="fontCss2">(s)</span> :<br/><br/>

$$T_c(s) = \frac{C(s). G(s)}{1 + C(s) . G(s)}$$
 
 
**PID Controller:**
								
A PID controller consists of 3 blocks: Proportional, Integral and Derivative. The equation governing the PID controller is as follows :<br/><br/>
								
$$u(t) = k_p. e(t) + k_i.\int{e(t)}dt + k_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}$$

$$e(t) = y_{desired}(t) - y(t)$$

With the means of laplace transform such a structure can be represented as a transfer function:<br/>

$$U(s) = ( k_p + \frac{k_i}{s} + k_d.s ). E(s)$$

$$C(s) = \frac{U(s)}{E(s)} = (k_p +\frac{k_i}{s} + k_d.s) = \frac{k_ds^2 + k_ps + k_i}{s}$$		
								
<div align="center">

<b>Fig 4: 1 DOF PID controller</b>
</div>

Each of the PID controller blocks (<span class="fontCss3">k<sub>p</sub></span>, <span class="fontCss3">k<sub>i</sub>/s</span>  and 
<span class="fontCss3">k<sub>d</sub>.s</span>) plays an important role. The proportional block is mostly responsible for the speed of the system reaction. However for oscillatory plants it might increase
the oscillations if the value of <span class="fontCss3">k<sub>p</sub></span> is set to be too large. The integral part is very important and assures zero error value in the steady state,
which means that the output will be exactly what we want it to be. Nevertheless the integral action of the controller causes the system to respond slower to
the desired value changes.<br/>

The derivative part has been introduced to make the response faster. However it is very sensitive to noise and may cause the system to react very nervously.
Thus very often it is omitted in the controller design. Derivative part output filtering may reduce the nervous reaction but also slows the response of 
the controller down. Proper filtering can help to reduce the high frequency noise without degrading the control system performance in the lower frequency band.
