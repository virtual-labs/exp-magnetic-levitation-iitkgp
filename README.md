### About the Experiment 
**System description**

The magnetic levitation (MAGLEV) is a non-contact technology . It reduces the cost of maintenance as there is no friction and so the energy efficiency is high. This technology is the future in transportation, non-contact actuators, precision engineering, non contact structures, satellite launching, etc. However, The open loop magnetic levitation system is highly nonlinear and highly unstable, and therefore, designing a simple and effective controller for such a system is very challenging.
