### About the Experiment 

The magneticlevitation(MAGLEV)is a non-contacttechnology.it reduces the cost of maintenance as there is no friction and so the energy efficiency is high.This technology is the future in
transportation,non-contact actuators,precision engineering,non-contact structures,satellitelaunching,etc.MLS considered for modeling consists of a ferromagnetic ball suspended in a voltage controlled magnetic field. Ferromagnetic core coil acts as actuator, sensor determining the position of ball with respect to core coil,
                                ferromagnetic ball has single degree of freedom.  MLS  consists of magnetic levitation mechanical unit (electromagnet, sensors, and ferromagnetic ball) with a computer
                                interface card, a signal conditioning unit, connecting cables.
